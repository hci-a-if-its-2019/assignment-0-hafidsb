# Assignment-0 Bad UI Design Example
### 1. Tvonline.id

Tvonline.id has some problem with the UI, namely: 
- The main logo is not cropped properly
- Doesn't utilize space wisely
- Untidy footer texts and some icons
- Not *aesthetic* play button

So to improve it we need to:
- Utilize space more efficiently
- Pay attention to minor detail such as the logo
- Tidy up texts and icons
- Using another video player if possible

### 2. Best-electronics-ca.com

The UI problem on this website would be:
- Confusing hyperlink
- No product grouping
- No frames
- Untidy margins
- Less pictures much words
- The color is not eye-catching
- The senteces is not used effectively(wasting user's time)

To fix them we could:
- Redesign the site entirely(seriously this is almost beyond repair :cold_sweat:)
  - Less words, more pictures
  - Using decent color combination
  - Arrange the content neater
  - Color the text correctly and uniquely
  
### 3. Mentalfloss.com

This site's UI problems are:
- Tha top navbar doesn't stick to the peak for a while
- Too much styling format in one page

We could try some of these things to make it better:
- Make the top navbar stick immidiately after scrolling down a little
- Thoose differernt styles could be placed in another page
